                    In collaboration with Codechef, CSPIT and DEPSTAR Charusat are hosting CODE PIE, a competitive programming
                    competition. As a result of this competition, students will be able to enhance their problem-solving skills and
                    their ability to brainstorm with their teammates. Our goal is to foster a competitive programming culture at our
                    university that will enable students to compete globally.
